# 🚀 Full Stack Developer JavaScript Problem Solving Tasks

This repository contains common **JavaScript problem-solving** and **functional programming** tasks often asked during **Full Stack Developer** interviews. Each task focuses on real-world scenarios involving arrays, objects, sorting, filtering, reducing, and function composition.

---

## 📌 Task List

### 1️⃣ Array Filtering and Mapping
- Create an array of objects, each representing a person with properties like `name`, `age`, and `gender`.
- Write a function to **filter out all females** and then **map the remaining people** to an array of names.
- Print the final result.

### 2️⃣ Object Manipulation
- Create an array of books with properties like `title`, `author`, and `year`.
- Write a function that returns an array containing **only the book titles**.

### 3️⃣ Function Composition
- Write three functions:
  - One to square a number.
  - One to double a number.
  - One to add 5 to a number.
- Compose these functions to create a new function that:
  1. Squares a number,
  2. Doubles the result,
  3. Then adds 5.

### 4️⃣ Sorting Objects
- Create an array of car objects with properties like `make`, `model`, and `year`.
- Write a function to **sort the cars by year (ascending)**.

### 5️⃣ Find and Modify
- Write a function that:
  - Searches an array of people for a specific name.
  - If found, updates their `age` property.
  - Print the updated array.

### 6️⃣ Array Reduction
- Create an array of numbers.
- Write a function using `.reduce()` to **sum all even numbers**.

### 7️⃣ Unique Values
- Create an array with **duplicate numbers**.
- Write a function to return a new array with **only unique values** using `Set` or filtering.

### 8️⃣ Advanced Sorting (By Average)
- Create an array of student objects with `name` and `grades` (array).
- Write a function to **sort students by average grade (descending)**.

### 9️⃣ Functional Programming – Reduce
- Write a function that uses `reduce()` to calculate the **total value** of an array of objects with `quantity` and `price`.

## ➕ Additional Questions (Recommended for Interview Prep)

### 🔟 String Reversal
- Write a function to reverse a string without using built-in `reverse()`.

### 🔢 Palindrome Checker
- Write a function that checks whether a given string is a **palindrome**.

### 🔍 Debounce Function (Advanced)
- Implement a `debounce()` function in JavaScript to delay function execution.

### 🧮 Fibonacci Series (Recursive & Iterative)
- Write functions to generate the nth number of a Fibonacci series both recursively and iteratively.

### 🔁 Deep Clone Object
- Implement a deep clone function for a nested JavaScript object without using `structuredClone()` or libraries like lodash.

### 🧠 Async/Await with Fetch
- Write a function to **fetch data from a public API** and print it using `async/await`.
